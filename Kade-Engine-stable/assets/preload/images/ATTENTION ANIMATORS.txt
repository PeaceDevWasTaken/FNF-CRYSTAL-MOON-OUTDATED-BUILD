To those who can animate cutscenes and can see this, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE HELP US.


We really could use some people to work on the fully animated cutscenes with voice acting and it would mean the world to the team and me if you would be willing to help.


PLEASE message me at Peace_Dev#0101 on discord if you want to help make this project the best it can be.


I look forward to seeing what you all can cook up for the team! :D
