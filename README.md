# FNF-Crystal-Moon
 FNF Crystal Moon is a heavy modification of Kade Engine which in tern is a improvement of the funky rythem game Friday Night Funkin'. Now Crystal moon offers a completely original story with new songs as well as fully animated and voice acted cutscenes, a custom difficutly, and a brand new fully custom Miss limit system that limits the ammount of misses you can gain depending on the dificulty you selected when playing. As well as a brand new perfect mode to make it so that when you miss a single note you Instantly fail the song and need to start all over again. The mod currently isnt public to download but as of right now for the developers of the mod it is set to public for ease of access.

Why are you still here go play it already?
